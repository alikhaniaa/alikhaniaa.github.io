    <h1>Statistical Pattern Recognition</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the course! Below is an outline of what we'll cover.</p>

    <!-- Example sections -->
    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Here we discuss the importance of pattern recognition in data science and machine learning.
      <br>We’ll cover classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, etc.
    </p>

    <h2 id="week1">Week 1: Basics</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Topics:</strong> Introduction to patterns, features, datasets, and the concept of recognition.
      <br>We’ll explore some real-world examples.
    </p>

    <h2 id="week2">Week 2: Probability</h2>
    <p>
      Probability foundations, random variables, distributions, and how they relate to classification tasks.
    </p>

    <h2 id="week3">Week 3: Classification</h2>
    <p>
      We delve into supervised learning, focusing on simple classifiers and evaluation metrics.
